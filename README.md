## 1. Finding the Smallest of Three Numbers

### Problem Description

Create a flowchart that takes three numbers as input and displays the smallest one among them.

### Approach

- The program will ask for three numbers as input.
- It will compare these numbers to find the smallest one using a series of conditional statements (if-else).
- The smallest number will be displayed to the user.

### Flowchart Description

1. Start
2. Input three numbers (a, b, c).
3. Compare the numbers:
   - If `a` is less than both `b` and `c`, display `a`.
   - Else if `b` is less than both `a` and `c`, display `b`.
   - Otherwise, display `c`.
4. End

## 2. Perfect Number Check

### Problem Description

Design a flowchart to check if a given positive integer is a perfect number.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (excluding 6) are 1, 2, and 3, and their sum equals 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6).

### Approach

1. Take a positive integer as input from the user.
2. Find all divisors of the number (excluding the number itself).
3. Sum the divisors.
4. If the sum equals the input number, it is a perfect number; otherwise, it is not.
